Skardu is one of the most beautiful places to travel in Pakistan, and if you’re asking me, this is an area you shouldn’t miss when visiting this country.
Located in Pakistan’s Northern Areas, Skardu is home to magnificent mountain landscapes, pristine lakes and extensive cold deserts. This is the gateway to some of the highest mountains in the world, and there are plenty of things to do here.

I spent two weeks in Skardu during my second visit to Pakistan, and this is one of my favourite destinations in the country. In this guide, you will find the best things to do in Skardu, from visiting its forts to hiking in the mountains.

It’s good to know that most of the places to visit in Skardu are located around the city, and the best way to visit them is by renting a car or motorbike.

Things to Do in Skardu
1. Visit Kharpocho Fort
The Kharpocho Fort, also known as Skardu Fort, was constructed between 1490 and 1505 by King Ali Sher Khan Anchan to protect the kingdom from invasions. Kharpocho means “King of Forts” in Balti, and the fort is located on top of a hill, overlooking the Skardu Valley.

To get there, you will have to hike up a trail for about 20 minutes, and the view along the way is magnificent. There’s not that much to see inside the fort itself (especially compared to Altit and Baltit Fort in Hunza), but the place is beautiful.

2. Head to the Sarfaranga Cold Desert
The Sarfaranga Cold Desert is a high-altitude desert located in the Shigar Valley, 16 km from Skardu. Standing at an elevation of 2,286 m (7,500 ft), this is one of the highest deserts in the world and one of the region’s highlights.

Once you reach the desert, you can simply admire it and hike, like I did, or engage in some adrenaline-rushing activities. Some of the best things to do here are to take a Jeep safari, rent a quad bike or go paragliding.

All in all, the Sarfaranga Cold Desert is a place you shouldn’t miss during a visit to Skardu. The landscapes are astonishing here, and it’s a great place for adventuring.

3. See the Katpana Cold Desert
Located 10 km (6 mi) from Skardu, the Katpana Cold Desert is also worth visiting. This desert is at an elevation of 2,226 m (7,303 ft) and it’s Pakistan’s second largest (after the Sarfaranga Desert, #2 on this list).

As you can’t engage in adventurous activities here, like in the Sarfaranga Desert, the Katpana Cold Desert is incredibly serene. This is a place I loved exploring, and it’s a nice place for a hike.

4. Admire the Lower and Upper Kachura Lakes
 Another amazing thing to do in Skardu is to visit the Kachura Lakes. These are a 30-minute drive from Skardu, and the best way to reach them is by car or motorbike.

Foroq Tso, or the Upper Kachura Lake, is my favourite. This stunning lake is surrounded by mountains, and its water is turquoise blue. What I love the most about this place is that it’s incredibly peaceful, although there are some places serving tea and snacks. I had an amazing time walking along the banks of the lake and didn’t encounter a single soul once I walked away from the main visitor’s place.

The Lower Kachura Lake, also known as Shangrila Lake, is an artificial lake established in 1983 as part of the first resort hotel in Skardu – Shangrila Resort Hotel. Its water comes from the Upper Kachura Lake and while the place is beautiful, it’s a little too artificial for me, but it’s a favourite among locals.

5. Hike to Marsur Rock
The hike to Marsur Rock is one of the most famous hikes in the area, and it’s easy to understand why: the place is spectacular!

This hike starts in Hussainabad, 20 km (12 mi) from Skardu, and it takes 2 to 4 hours to hike up, depending on your pace. Once you reach Marsur Rock, you will be rewarded with a spectacular view of the surroundings. This is a great place to snap pictures and take in the amazing mountain scenery.

Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to hike to Marsur Rock when I was in Skardu due to food poisoning, but this is a place I will definitely visit in the future, as I’m planning to go back.

6. Go to Shigar
The village of Shigar is a 45 km (28 mi) drive from Skardu, and as the Sarfaranga Cold Desert (#2 on this list) is on the way here, these places are easy to combine, which is what I did.

Shigar is famous for being home to the 17th-century Shigar Fort and the 14th-century Amburiq Mosque. Both of these are stunning, and you don’t want to miss them if you’re into history or architecture.

I also loved exploring this village’s little streets and alleys, and it’s good to know that the surrounding Shigar Valley is stunning as well!

7. Shop at the Bazaar
One of my favourite things to do when visiting a new city is to check out the local bazaar. This is a nice way to explore the place and get a taste of local life.

Although you will find more bazaars in cities like Lahore and Karachi, it is worth spending some time at Skardu’s bazaar too. You might find a nice Pakistani souvenir here.

8. See the Manthal Buddha Rock
If you’re interested in history, the Manthal Buddha Rock is a place you cannot miss during a visit to Skardu. It’s right outside the city and dates back to the 8th century.

At the time, monks from Northern India ruled Northern Pakistan (as well as parts of neighbouring Afghanistan), and this is one of the most important remains of the region’s Buddhist past. You will see that a relief sculpture of the Buddha was carved on this granite rock.

It’s interesting to note that the Manthal Buddha Rock was only discovered in 1906 due to its remote location. Today, this is one of Skardu’s highlights, though.

9. Go to Satpara Lake
Famous for its blue colour and stunning surrounding scenery, Sapara Lake is a great place to hike or simply enjoy the views. A popular activity here is hiking around the lake, which isn’t too difficult.

This lake is just a 9 km (5,5 mi) drive from Skardu, and you will pass the Manthal Buddha Rock (#8 on this list) on the way here, so these places are ideal to combine.

10. Visit Khaplu
The Khaplu Valley is a 110 km (68 mi) drive from Skardu, and it’s stunning. I visited it for just one day, but would actually love to go back and stay a little longer.

Here, you will find the beautiful Khaplu Cones (not to be confused with the Passu Cones in the Hunza Valley), the gorgeous Kharfaq Lake, the majestic Khaplu Palace and the 14th-century Chaqchan Mosque. Unfortunately, this last one cannot be visited if you’re not Muslim, which is uncommon in Pakistan.

If you enjoy hiking, it’s good to know that Khaplu is also a nice place to do this, as the region is stunning and there are many beautiful viewpoints.

11. Admire the Manthoka Waterfall
Located in the Kharmang Valley, about 80 km (50 mi) from Skardu, the Manthoka Waterfall is one of the largest in the region. The surrounding landscapes are stunning, and the waterfall is easily accessible by road.

Note that the road to get to this waterfall isn’t very good. I was planning on visiting it on the way to Khaplu, but didn’t make it because I was short on time (and didn’t have a 4×4).

12. Make a Trip to Deosai National Park
Deosai National Park is a high-altitude alpine plain, famous for its lush green landscapes. With an elevation of 4,114 m (13,497 ft), this is one of the world’s highest plateaus, and it’s home to animals like the endangered Himalayan brown bear, musk deer, ibex, urial and markhor.

If you enjoy hiking, this is a place you cannot miss. There are campgrounds inside the national park, so it’s possible to spend the night here.

It’s good to know that Deosai National Park is a 30 km (18 mi) drive from Skardu and that you will need a 4×4 to get there, as the road is bad.

Winter (December to March): While winter is beautiful in Skardu, it will be cold at this time, and many roads and hiking trails will be inaccessible because of the snow, so this is not a great time to visit.
