Pakistan’s cultural capital, Lahore, is the second-largest city in the country, and it’s an incredibly interesting destination. From ancient forts to colourful mosques, there are many amazing places to visit in Lahore, and this guide includes the ones you cannot miss.

Lahore’s beautiful architecture, rich history and friendly locals have made it one of my all-time favourite cities. I’ve visited Lahore three times and spent a total of five weeks here, and I keep discovering amazing new places.

I recommend spending at least two days in Lahore, three would be even better if you want to make the most out of your time here. This city has a lot to offer, and you will want to taste the famous Lahori cuisine too, after all.

But without further ado, here are the best places to visit in Lahore, the cultural capital of Pakistan (and one of Asia’s best cultural destinations if you’re asking me).

14 Best Places to Visit in Lahore:

1. Lahore Fort:
Lahore Fort is one of these places you cannot miss during a visit to Lahore. It was once the home of the royal emperors of the Mughal reign, and it’s got an incredibly rich history.

The fort has been rebuilt numerous times over the years, but its current structures date back to 1566. In the 16th century, however, Emperor Jahangir modified it. Later, the fort was damaged by the Sikhs and the British, but it has been restored since.

There are plenty of things to see at Lahore Fort, but its absolute highlights are Alamgiri Gate and the beautiful Sheesh Mahal.

2. Badshahi Mosque:
Badshahi Mosque is located right next to Lahore Fort, and it’s one of my favourite places in the city. This is the third-largest mosque in Pakistan, but it was the city’s largest when it was constructed in 1673.

The construction of the mosque was commissioned by Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, and it’s made of red sandstone that was imported from Jaipur, India’s so-called Pink City. The mosque’s enormous courtyard can accommodate up to a whopping 100,000 people, and wait until you see its prayer chamber – it’s stunning!

All in all, Badshahi Mosque is one of Asia’s most beautiful landmarks, and it can’t be missed during a visit to Lahore. If you’re asking me, this mosque alone makes it worth adding this city to your itinerary for Pakistan.
Don’t forget to bring a scarf if you’re a woman. You will have to cover your head when you enter mosques. Make sure to read my post on what to wear in Pakistan (for both men and women), as this is a conservative Muslim country that’s pretty off the beaten path.

3. Minar-e-Pakistan:
This 70-m (230 ft) high minaret is of great historical importance for Pakistan. It commemorates the Lahore Resolution, which was held here in 1940.

Back then, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan were still one country, and this was the resolution for the establishment of a separate homeland for British India’s Muslims (which would later become East Pakistan – now Pakistan, and West Pakistan – now Bangladesh).

Minar-e-Pakistan was built in the 1960s in a mix of Islamic, Mughal and contemporary architecture. It can be found in the Greater Iqbal Park, which is next to the Badshahi Mosque and the Lahore Fort.

4. Wazir Khan Mosque
The beautiful Wazir Khan Mosque is another one of my favourite places to visit in Lahore. Located in the heart of the Walled City, this mosque was completed in 1641.

The Wazir Khan Mosque was built around the tomb of Saint Miran Badshah at the demand of Shaikh Ilam-ud-din Ansari  (who was known as Wazir Khan). Ansari was the governor of Punjab under the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, who is famous for building the Taj Mahal in India.

You will find colourful frescoes and mosaics all over this mosque’s walls, ceilings and minarets. The mosque’s mosaics are argued to be the most beautiful mosaic tile work of all the mosques built during the Mughal period, and I can see why.

5. Shahi Hammam
Also known as the Wazir Khan Hammam, the Shahi Hammam is a 5-minute walk from the Wazir Khan Mosque. Just like the mosque, this Persian-style hammam was also built at the demand of Governor Ansari in the 17th century.

During the fall of the Mughal Empire, the hammam fell into disuse, and it was used as a school, recreational centre and dispensary during British rule. Between 2013 and 2015, however, the hammam was beautifully restored, and it can now be visited.

The hammam is full of well-preserved frescoes, and its water-heating structure and drainage systems have been unearthed.

6. Walled City:
One of the best things to do in Lahore is to get lost in the Walled City (also known as the Old City), which is the heart of Lahore. All of the places mentioned above are located here, but there’s much more to this part of Lahore.

The Walled City’s little streets feel like a maze, and you will come across plenty of small shops, markets and mosques here. I spent hours wandering around the area and still haven’t seen all of it – it’s huge!

Another thing that makes the Walled City so nice is its welcoming locals. Not everyone speaks English, but the people here will still welcome you with open arms.

7. Delhi Gate
There used to be 13 gates leading to the Walled City of Lahore, which were joined by a brick wall. These were built during the Mughal Empire. Today, however, only six of these gates remain.

Delhi Gate is the most impressive of the remaining gates. If you don’t have the time to see all of them, do make sure to pass through this one. This is a great place to start exploring the Walled City as well.

You may wonder why this gate was named after Delhi, India’s capital. The reason is that it’s pointing in the direction of this city.

👜 You will find a bustling bazaar right behind this gate, and the beautiful Wazir Khan Mosque is just a minute’s walk from here.

8. Lahore Museum
If you would like to learn more about Pakistan’s history, art and culture, then the Lahore Museum is the place to go. This is the largest museum in Pakistan, and it features numerous artefacts from various periods.

Some of Lahore Museum’s most famous artefacts are its collection of Gandhara art, coins, miniatures and manuscripts. You will also find contemporary art, Islamic art and a gallery containing artefacts that tell the story of the Freedom Movement here.

9. Anarkali Bazaar
Anarkali Bazaar is one of Pakistan’s oldest markets. It’s located right outside the Walled City, and it’s the perfect place to go shopping for clothes, shoes, bangles, sweets, handicrafts, etc. You might just find the perfect Pakistani souvenir here.

But even if you’re not into shopping, Anarkali Bazaar is a great place to walk around, try local food and soak up the atmosphere.

The bazaar is divided into two sections – Old Anarkali Bazaar and New Anarkali Bazaar. You will find clothes and accessories at Old Anarkali Bazar, while New Anarkali Bazar is famous for its Pakistani food.

Make sure to check out Anarkali Food Street too while you’re in the neighbourhood, you will find some delicious pani puri here!

10. Food Street
There are multiple food streets in Lahore, but the most famous one is Fort Road Food Street, just a 5-minute walk from Badshahi Mosque and Lahore Fort.

This street is famous for its restaurants in beautifully renovated buildings serving Lahori cuisine. Cooco’s Den and Haveli Restaurant are great choices if you want to enjoy a view like this:

I visited Cooko’s Den around noon, but I recommend coming here for sunset if you can. It might be busier then, but the view over Badshahi Mosque will be even more spectacular!

During my second visit to Lahore, I went to Haveli Restaurant in the evening. The view was amazing and the food was delicious, but it was a bit crowded because it’s a very popular place.

11. Data Darbar
Data Darbar is the largest Sufi shrine in South Asia. It’s considered one of the most sacred places in Lahore, and it attracts thousands of visitors every single day.

The shrine was built around the tomb of the 11th-century Sufi Saint Ali Hujwiri, who came to Lahore from present-day Afghanistan to spread Islam. Hujwiri is one of the most respected Muslim saints, and it’s believed that he lived on the grounds of this shrine.

It’s good to know that there are separate entrances for men and women. So if you’re visiting Data Darbar as a couple, you won’t be able to enter together.

12. Tomb of Jahangir
The Tomb of Jahangir was the first place I visited in Lahore, and I couldn’t have wished for a better introduction to the city – it’s stunning!

Jahangir was the fourth Mughal Emperor, and this mausoleum was built after his death in the 17th century. The ground where it was built was the favourite spot of the emperor and his wife.

With its remarkable Mughal architecture and enormous gardens surrounding it, the Tomb of Jahangir makes sure to impress. Inside, you will find a marble cenotaph ornamented with beautiful pietra dura mosaics – a photographer’s dream!

13. Wagah Border
The Wagah border is the only open land border between Pakistan and India. It connects Lahore and Amritsar, famous for being home to the Golden Temple of the Sikhs.

A ceremony, called the Wagah Border Ceremony or Beating Retreat Ceremony, has been held at this border every day since 1959. During this ceremony, both Pakistani as well as Indian soldiers will parade along the road, after which the flags of both countries will be lowered and the gates will close. This is quite an impressive spectacle, especially when you think of the countries’ turbulent relationship.

The Wagah Border is a 30-minute drive from Lahore, and the ceremony is definitely worth attending.

14. Shalimar Gardens
If you’re looking for an escape from the hustle and bustle of the Walled City, then the Shalimar Gardens (or Shalimar Bagh) are the perfect place to take a stroll.

These gardens were made during the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in the 17th century, and they were used by the royal family to entertain guests.

The highlight of the Shalimar Gardens is the big pool with fountains, although I don’t think the fountains run frequently. Here, you can see a white platform, which is where the king would sit.

Best Time to Visit Lahore
The best time to visit Lahore is from February to April. At this time of the year, the temperatures are between 14°C and 29°C (58°F – 85°F) and there’s not so much rain. You will find an overview of the seasons below:

Winter (October to February): The winter months are great if you like cooler weather, though the city might be misty. At this time of the year, temperatures will be between 8°C and 21°C (46°F – 69°F).
Spring (March to May): Spring is the perfect time to visit Lahore, with temperatures between 14°C and 29°C (58°F – 85°F) and clear skies.
Summer (June to September): Lahore is scorching hot during summer, with temperatures of over 40°C (105°F). On top of that, this is also the rainy season.
I visited Lahore in April, December and February, and April was my favourite month when it comes to the weather.


How to Get Around Lahore
Lahore is a big city, and although many tourist attractions are within walking distance of one another, some are a little further away. You will find the best ways to get around Lahore below:

Auto-rickshaw: The easiest and cheapest way to get around is by taking a rickshaw. You will find these nearly everywhere in Lahore.
Public transportation: If you’re on a tight budget and would like to get around using public transportation, the metrobus and the Lahore metro are your best friends. This being said, public transportation is still being developed in Lahore. This means that you might end up having to take a rickshaw too to get where you need to be.
Private car: You can hire a private car to get around Lahore for the day, but this will be more expensive.
Tour: If you’d rather explore Lahore with a local guide, I recommend Michael and Samuel, who can take you to the Walled City’s hidden gems. I ran into Samuel one day, and was surprised to see how many interesting sights I missed when he showed me around for a couple of hours.

Where to Stay in Lahore
There are plenty of hotels in Lahore; it all depends on your personal taste and budget. You will find my top recommendations below.

Luxus Grand Hotel (⭐ 9.2/10, $$$): This is one of Lahore’s top hotels. Its rooms are magnificent and there’s an indoor swimming pool as well.
Faletti’s Grand MM (⭐ 9.0/10, $$): Faletti’s Grand MM is a beautiful mid-range hotel with spacious rooms and all the facilities you might need.
Five Giants Homestay (⭐ 9.7/10, $): Although I didn’t stay here myself, this is an affordable homestay that many travellers recommended to me. It’s located in a quiet area, it’s clean, and there’s a shared kitchen.
